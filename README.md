# Pacman

A game of Pacman where the player is chased by a ghost around a maze.

This is a project I did for fun without following any tutorials. I used the knowledge that I gained from my particle simulation projects and built upon it by adding an AI element and a map.


By doing this project I taught myself the basics of AI, real time applications and screen rendering, capturing keyboard inputs and creating a game map.
